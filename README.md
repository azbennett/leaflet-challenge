# Included files:  
* README.md - this file
* index.html - core HTML file that pulls the EQ.js file
* EQ.js - my code of javascript for the earthquake visualization

* Core source material came from module 15 - day 1 - activity number 10. Adjusted the markers into a size and color based function in place of it.

** "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'." From what I understand this is a common error on gitpages  that ignore google's cookie rules.  Does not affect the work.
